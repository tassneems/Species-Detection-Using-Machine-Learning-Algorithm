        This tool uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect and classify bird species, specifically Erithacus rubecula (European Robin), 
        Periparus ater (Coal Tit), and Pica pica (Eurasian Magpie). By identifying these species accurately, this project contributes to wildlife conservation efforts, 
        enabling researchers to track bird populations and study behavioral patterns over time.
